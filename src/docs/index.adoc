== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Order Management Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing orders in {gr8crm} applications.

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-order-ui/[crm-order-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for managing orders.
`crm-order-ui` depends on `crm-order` so you only need to include `crm-order-ui`
in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user order management features.

== Domain Model

== CrmOrderService

Like most other {gr8crm} plugins this plugin have a main service with methods for creating, searching and updating orders.

=== Create order type

`CrmOrderType createOrderType(Map params, boolean save = false)`

Order type is mandatory on an order and different order types can be created with `createOrderType()`.

=== Create order status

`CrmOrderStatus createOrderStatus(Map params, boolean save = false)`

Order status is mandatory on an order and different order statuses can be created with `createOrderStatus()`.

=== Create delivery type

`CrmDeliveryType createDeliveryType(Map params, boolean save = false)`

Delivery type is mandatory on an order and different delivery types can be created with `createDeliveryType()`.

=== Create a new order

`CrmOrder saveOrder(CrmOrder order, Map params)`

To create a new order you call the saveOrder method with a map of property values and either an existing `CrmOrder` instance
or `null` to have the method create an instance for you.

    customerFirstName: "Joe", customerLastName: "Average", customerCompany: "Company Inc.",
    'invoice.address1': "Main Road 1234", 'invoice.postalCode': "12345", 'invoice.city': "Stockholm",
